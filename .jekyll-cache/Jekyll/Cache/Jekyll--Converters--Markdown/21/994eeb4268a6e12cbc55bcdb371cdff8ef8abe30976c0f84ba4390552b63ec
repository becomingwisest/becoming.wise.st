I"·<p>As part of my better habits, Iâ€™ve been reading books more. I have a few that Iâ€™m in the middle of reading, but <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Continuous-Delivery-Deployment-Automation-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321601912">Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation</a> is the one Iâ€™ve been using to count for my streaks. Its been nice to have access to a variety of books to read.</p>
