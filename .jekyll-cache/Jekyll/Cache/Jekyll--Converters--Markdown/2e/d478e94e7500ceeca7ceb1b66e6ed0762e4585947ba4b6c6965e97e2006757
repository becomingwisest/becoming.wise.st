I"ˆ<p>When I <a href="/2016/05/08/welcome-to-jekyll.html">recently migrated</a> to <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/.">Jekyll</a>, I went down the route of storing my blog in git. Since Iâ€™ve started to want to blog more often, I needed some way to work on posts while my main desktop was in use.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="https://keybase.io/">Keybase.io</a>. They have <a href="https://keybase.io/docs/kbfs">kbfs</a> which provides me plenty of storage (10 GB) for a git repo of my blog. When I first pushed up to the repo, it took probably a few minutes to encrypt, sync, etc. But then I was able to easily clone from my work laptop, and work on another post.</p>

<p>Steps to set it up on my desktop:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>cd repos/becoming.wise.st</p>

  <p>git init â€“bare /keybase/private/becomingwisest/becoming.wise.st.git</p>

  <p>git remote add origin /keybase/private/becomingwisest/becoming.wise.st.git</p>

  <p>git branch -u origin/master</p>

  <p>git push origin master</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And on my laptop, its quite easy.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>cd repos</p>

  <p>git clone /keybase/private/becomingwisest/becoming.wise.st.git</p>
</blockquote>
