I"|<p>There is a place where I visit almost everyday, Hangops. For me it started as the videos that they built using Googleâ€™s Hangouts, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/hangops">posted to YouTube</a>. But it has grown to a slack community that is there for you. If you would like to join too, come on over to the <a href="https://signup.hangops.com/">signup page</a>.</p>
