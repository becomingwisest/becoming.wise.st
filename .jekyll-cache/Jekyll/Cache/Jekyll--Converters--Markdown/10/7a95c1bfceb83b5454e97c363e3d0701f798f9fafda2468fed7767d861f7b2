I"·<p>As Iâ€™ve gained experience working in IT, Iâ€™ve learned to love trails left behind. When trying to figure out how a server was setup for a customer, its great when it has a runbook for them. When wondering why something was done, its great both whet the commit message goes into details of of the what and why, and any tickets related to the work. When looking at a change ticket, its great it can be linked to the story or epic.</p>
