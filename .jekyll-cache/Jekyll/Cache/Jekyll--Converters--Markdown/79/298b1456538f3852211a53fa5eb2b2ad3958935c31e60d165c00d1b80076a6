I"w<p>This blog has gone without and to reboot I’m giving Jekyll a try. It was able to import my old posts with ease. At the same time, I’m migrating the site from a personal vm, to AWS’s CloudFront and S3. Pennies to run, and I get to play with AWS again.</p>

<p>I’m not making any promises of future updates, but that is what <a href="/feed.xml">RSS</a> is for.</p>
