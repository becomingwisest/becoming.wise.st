I"z<p>Back in March, I got a <a href="https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/yubikey4/">Yubikey4</a>. I already had two of the <a href="https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/fido-u2f-security-key/">Github branded U2F devices</a>, but Iâ€™ve always enjoyed security and public key crypto. The YubiKey4 supports 4096 bit GPG keys, which should last a while.</p>
