I"<p>I’ve been following Julia Evans, <a href="https://twitter.com/b0rk">@b0rk on Twitter</a> for a while. But what inspired this post was me going through my Instapaper backlog. Her article <a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2016/04/30/building-expertise-at-work/">How does knowledge get locked up in people’s heads? or, “Building expertise at work”</a> has hit home for me because I’ve been with my company three years. I’ve had to find out how something works, and I’ve needed to pass on knowledge I’ve learned to others. She has written about <a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2016/05/22/how-do-you-write-blog-posts/">why she blogs</a>, and <a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2016/06/12/a-weird-system-call-process-vm-readv/">how to spy on what ruby is doing</a>.</p>

<p>She has also <a href="http://jvns.ca/zines/">started making zines</a> about what she she’s learned. Currently stocked are: strace, and Linux debugging tools.</p>
