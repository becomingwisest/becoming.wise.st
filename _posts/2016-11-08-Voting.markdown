Today is general election in the United States of America. The presidential election seems more polarized then in the past from my memory. I will admit that I'm swayed by my feelings on the subject, and haven't done as much reseach as I feel it deserves.

But today I voted. I gave my opinion on everything in front of me, down to the local city and school district. On Facebook, I did the 'voted selfie', and have been liking postings by my friends, giving them positive feedback. On Twitter I asked [I voted. Will you?](https://twitter.com/becomingwisest/status/796106787829055488).

When it comes to voting, I think you should lend your voice to the common. I think you and I should research and know the issues, and have logical reasons to vote the way you do. But I believe in improvements. Just get out and vote for one role/issue, and then build that habit. Learn about the issues so you can do better next time.
