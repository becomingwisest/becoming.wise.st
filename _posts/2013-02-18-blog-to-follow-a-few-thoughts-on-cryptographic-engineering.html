title: 'Blog to follow: A Few Thoughts on Cryptographic Engineering'
---

<p>I came across Matthew Green&#8217;s <a href="http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/">A Few Thoughts on Cryptographic Engineering</a> blog recently, and have found the site worthy to follow. Everything I have read is well written, and informative. His <a href="http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2012/05/tale-of-two-patches.html">A tale of two patches</a> post covers some of the flaws in openssl that where patched in early 2012. While his <a href="http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2012/05/future-of-electronic-currency.html">The future of electronic currency</a> post does talk about our near future options for digial currency, it is more informative about what has been tried in the past, and reasons why it did not work.</p>

<p>He also tends to rant in his posts, giving his reasons why he thinks the way he does. In <a href="http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2011/11/bram-cohen-corrects-me.html">Bram Cohen corrects me?</a> the rant becomes a coversation between himself and Bram Cohen over two blog posts, and into the comments of both articles.</p>

<p>If you have interest in cryptography from an opinionated researcher, pleese to checkout his blog.</p>
