        <title>Playing with: YubiKey 4C Nano</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I got my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/yubikey4/&quot;&gt;YubiKey 4C Nano&lt;/a&gt; to join my ‘new’ work laptop. I figured I should follow up from my earlier post ‘&lt;a href=&quot;/2016/09/29/playing-with-yubikey.html&quot;&gt;Playing with: YubiKey4&lt;/a&gt;’. I quickly added it to &lt;a href=&quot;https://myaccount.google.com/u/1/signinoptions/two-step-verification&quot;&gt;my Google account&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/settings/two_factor_authentication/configure&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;
Back in March, I got a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/yubikey4/&quot;&gt;Yubikey4&lt;/a&gt;. Next was to import my existing GPG key to the card, and make new subkeys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First to setup the device, I launched the GUI YubiKey Manager version 1.4.1. It prompted me to set the PIN. I then selected Manage device PINs, and configured a nice long random Management Key. After these steps, commands I was using to have gpg talk to the card were failing. I pulled the device from its port, re-inserted, and gpg –card-status worked.&lt;/p&gt;

OK&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then went to see if maybe my tools were out of date, and I downloaded version 1.4.2 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yubico.com/support/knowledge-base/categories/articles/piv-tools/&quot;&gt;YubiKey PIV Manager&lt;/a&gt; which seemed ‘slow’ to download, taking 2-4 minutes to download ~20 MB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still was messing up the PIN, but using the PIV Manager, I was able to reset the device, and assigned a PIN, and a long management key, which also allowed me to set a PUK. I skipped the Set Up YubiKey for MacOS, which would allow me to use my PIN with my key to login to my computer. This is because of FUD, I’d heard in the past that it might cause issues with gpg-agent being able to tie into the key too. And I use my finger print to login anyways, so no ease of use advantage there.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Personal: Voting</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today is general election in the United States of America. The presidential election seems more polarized then in the past from my memory. I will admit that I’m swayed by my feelings on the subject, and haven’t done as much reseach as I feel it deserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But today I voted. I gave my opinion on everything in front of me, down to the local city and school district. On Facebook, I did the ‘voted selfie’, and have been liking postings by my friends, giving them positive feedback. On Twitter I asked &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/becomingwisest/status/796106787829055488&quot;&gt;I voted. Will you?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to voting, I think you should lend your voice to the common. I think you and I should research and know the issues, and have logical reasons to vote the way you do. But I believe in improvements. Just get out and vote for one role/issue, and then build that habit. Learn about the issues so you can do better next time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Bookshelf: Continuous Delivery</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of my better habits, I’ve been reading books more. I have a few that I’m in the middle of reading, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Continuous-Delivery-Deployment-Automation-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321601912&quot;&gt;Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation&lt;/a&gt; is the one I’ve been using to count for my streaks. Its been nice to have access to a variety of books to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m only barely into the beginning of the book, but what it says rings true. Have your code and systems always in a state that can be deployed. Have quick tests that run on every commit to ensure we don’t break it. QA should be similar to production. Actually having things break early is a good sign, because it means it was caught close to the change, and can be fixed instead of being discovered when released. The system is more then just the code, its also the infrasturcture and configurations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan on updating more as I get deeper into the book and finish it. But I’d also like to call out how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.safaribooksonline.com&quot;&gt;Safari by O’Reilly&lt;/a&gt; is a great resource when you have the time to learn. Plenty of books covery many topics, and they also have videos if reading isn’t your style.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Streaks: Building Habits</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been trying to improve myself, and build new habits. For the past two months I’ve been using &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/streaks/id963034692?mt=8&quot;&gt;Streaks&lt;/a&gt; to help with this. Some of the habits are health related, while others are personal growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve set health goals to build habits. Taking X thousand steps a day. As you keep hitting that goal, it offers to increase the habit, and have you level up. It does the same for climbing flights of stairs. I also use the daily reminder to brush my teeth. Since its keeping track, there is a mental alarm inside to try and hit each target goal. I have fallen, but then I just work to build up the streak again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The personal goals have been good too. I’ve got a goal to take a photo five days a week, and I’ve gotten back into the habit of taking cloudy morning sunrise pictures, or pictures of flowers that I find. Reading for 10 minutes has lead to me making progress with learning how to update puppet, and improve the devops culture at my work. My weekly goal of blogging has lead to this material you’ve seen grow here online. I do tend to put it off for the end of the week, but near the end I always find something to write about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So set goals, build habits. And if you use iOS, give Streaks a try.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>PuppetConf: 2016 (Upgrading, Community, and Culture)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I just came pack from PuppetConf 2016. My main purpose was to learn about the features of Puppet 4, and how to get there. It was also an opportunity to participate in the community and the ecosystem of modules it creates. It also gave me ideas to change the culture at our company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are running on an earlier version of Puppet 3.3. This allows us to support our existing infrastructure, but is causing issues upgrading portions of it. I can’t use software that requires a newer version of PuppetDB. We have added a few Ubuntu 14.04 systems running Puppet 3.8, but those complain on every run. In looking to upgrade, I’m finding manifests that have errors when running. I plan on fixing all our broken doors and windows, getting puppet to not error, and not trying to run corrective action on every run. This will allow me to upgrade puppet and see if anything changes in QA. Any changes will be investigated allowing me to fix any issues with our manifests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Puppet is working on building its community. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://forge.puppet.com/&quot;&gt;Puppet Forge&lt;/a&gt; is a source of community contributed modules. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://forge.puppet.com/approved&quot;&gt;Puppet Approved Modules&lt;/a&gt; are those that Puppet says meets quality requirements, and provides a starting point of modules to use. Join the &lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.puppet.com/&quot;&gt;Puppet Community&lt;/a&gt; on Slack, and find a community focused on helping, guiding, and mentoring all members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several things at the conference helped inspire me on how our company culture can change. Three authors of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://itrevolution.com/devops-handbook&quot;&gt;DevOps Handbook: 
How to Create World-Class Agility, Reliability, &amp;amp; Security in Technology Organizations&lt;/a&gt; book was there, and were giving out copies from their publisher IT Revolution. It gives advice on implementing a DevOps culture, enabling a company to be able to react to the market, try things out, and bring it to market quickly. Our company has many of the systems in place. We allow developers to deploy code on their schedule. Developers can also self service creating vms to test out ideas, and even change puppet to help support such ideas. But we could use more automation within IT. Our own infrastructure is hard to duplicate, replicate, and recover from disasters. We could also use more automation with puppet, having more tests, deploying more often, and allowing developers and others the ability to change their settings within puppet. There was also a track dedicated to &lt;a href=&quot;https://puppetconf2016.sched.org/type/track+1%3A+culture&quot;&gt;Culture&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attending PuppetConf has giving me ideas of things to try out. I look forward to the videos to be published, and check out the tracks that will give me even more ideas. After my broken windows are fixed, we will be able to explore, try new things myself, and have others be free to try things too.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My community, hangops</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a place where I visit almost everyday, Hangops. For me it started as the videos that they built using Google’s Hangouts, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/hangops&quot;&gt;posted to YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. But it has grown to a slack community that is there for you. If you would like to join too, come on over to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://signup.hangops.com/&quot;&gt;signup page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main channel has “be excellent to each other” in its topic. This is where most of the conversation happens, and topic range from what people are working on, their latest thing they’ve learned, to even the local weather. If you are having trouble with something, and don’t want to interrupt the conversation, head on over to &lt;em&gt;#help&lt;/em&gt;. About 10 percent of the members are there too, and will highlight in the feed that somebody is looking for advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other channels help you with working. There is &lt;em&gt;#career_advice&lt;/em&gt;, a place to learn and contribute to leveling up your career. A corollary channel, &lt;em&gt;#job_board&lt;/em&gt; helps you find that next job if you are done with where you are now. If you want to improve your work environment, visit &lt;em&gt;#culture&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are topical channels so you can find like minded people. I lurk in &lt;em&gt;#puppet&lt;/em&gt;, and get help when I have issues with my upgrade path of puppet. &lt;em&gt;#home_infrastructure&lt;/em&gt; is great to talk about what gadgets you have, automating your house, building something to play on, or having a home lab to level up your technical skills. &lt;em&gt;#infosec&lt;/em&gt; is where I learn new things about security, and push people to get a YubiKey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also the more social channels I use. &lt;em&gt;#book-club&lt;/em&gt; is great to find something new or old to read. &lt;em&gt;#pets-of-hangops&lt;/em&gt; is great to find pictures of cuteness. &lt;em&gt;#ladevops&lt;/em&gt; is my regional channel, but other channels use area codes to find the people near you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last channel I’ll talk about is &lt;em&gt;#mental_health&lt;/em&gt;. This is a place to learn that you are not alone. We are there to support each other, and help people find professional help that works for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hangops is a place that I’ve learned new things, but I also feel I can contribute to. Since the videos that spawned the slack have been occurring with less frequency, we are looking to see how it will continue. Follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitter.com/hangops&quot;&gt;@hangops on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; to find out what is happening there. I’ve turned on mobile notifications for their tweets, so I know the urls of the hangout when it starts.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Note: Be sure to leave a trail</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As I’ve gained experience working in IT, I’ve learned to love trails left behind. When trying to figure out how a server was setup for a customer, its great when it has a runbook for them. When wondering why something was done, its great both whet the commit message goes into details of of the what and why, and any tickets related to the work. When looking at a change ticket, its great it can be linked to the story or epic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in 2008, we weren’t using configuration management yet, so no repeatable builds. We hadn’t gotten to the point of documenting how servers got setup. Thankfully our co-worker &lt;a href=&quot;http://agiletesting.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Grig Gheorghiu&lt;/a&gt; wrote a blog post about this one step. Twice we used google and find his post &lt;a href=&quot;http://agiletesting.blogspot.com/2008/05/compiling-python-25-with-ssl-support.html&quot;&gt;Compiling Python 2.5 with SSL support&lt;/a&gt;. Thankfully that breadcrumb was there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I became the SME of puppet, being responible for the code that gets accepted in pull request, I’ve started to harp on commit messages. People submitting pull requests have come to learn I will ask for tickets to be listed in the commit message if there is one. Sometimes thats all they do however. One person, looking at the commit message history has ‘Changes for TICKET-####’. While this at least gives a breadcrumb of information, it has lead me to try and find a good guide to pass out, and link to. My first google hit in searching found &lt;a href=&quot;http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/&quot;&gt;How to Write a Git Commit Message by Chris Beams&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When planning something that takes more then a unit of work, its great when the story/epic lays out the transition plan. Then tickets can be linked to the epic, or sub tasks can be created as work is found. I think this helps justify the individual work unit. People can look into why they are doing the changes, catch unexpressed assumptions, or at least know why this grind is happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these trails that give either outright reasons, or at least clues as to how or why something was done is helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Playing with: Keybase.io, git, and Jekyll</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When I &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/08/welcome-to-jekyll.html&quot;&gt;recently migrated&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/.&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;, I went down the route of storing my blog in git. Since I’ve started to want to blog more often, I needed some way to work on posts while my main desktop was in use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;a href=&quot;https://keybase.io/&quot;&gt;Keybase.io&lt;/a&gt;. They have &lt;a href=&quot;https://keybase.io/docs/kbfs&quot;&gt;kbfs&lt;/a&gt; which provides me plenty of storage (10 GB) for a git repo of my blog. When I first pushed up to the repo, it took probably a few minutes to encrypt, sync, etc. But then I was able to easily clone from my work laptop, and work on another post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steps to set it up on my desktop:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;cd repos/becoming.wise.st&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;git init –bare /keybase/private/becomingwisest/becoming.wise.st.git&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;git remote add origin /keybase/private/becomingwisest/becoming.wise.st.git&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;git branch -u origin/master&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;git push origin master&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And on my laptop, its quite easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;cd repos&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;git clone /keybase/private/becomingwisest/becoming.wise.st.git&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Playing with: YubiKey4</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in March, I got a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/yubikey4/&quot;&gt;Yubikey4&lt;/a&gt;. I already had two of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/fido-u2f-security-key/&quot;&gt;Github branded U2F devices&lt;/a&gt;, but I’ve always enjoyed security and public key crypto. The YubiKey4 supports 4096 bit GPG keys, which should last a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I already had &lt;a href=&quot;https://gpgtools.org/&quot;&gt;GPGTools&lt;/a&gt; installed, so now it was a question of how to set it up. With some searching I found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.esev.com/blog/post/2015-01-pgp-ssh-key-on-yubikey-neo/&quot;&gt;Eric Severance’s blog post: PGP and SSH keys on a Yubikey NEO&lt;/a&gt;, and used that to crib my setup. I kept failing setting it up, or at least accessing the key afeter import. With some searching, I probably found &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.yubico.com/yubico-piv-tool/YubiKey_PIV_introduction.html&quot;&gt;YubiKey PIV introduction&lt;/a&gt; which provides:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The default PIN code is 123456. The default PUK code is 12345678.
The default 3DES management key (9B) is 010203040506070801020304050607080102030405060708.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After playing around a few times, I settled on using BF2D00BCEC46EA7B for work and personal use. I followed the directions to get my key usable with ssh via the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gpgkey2ssh&lt;/code&gt; tool. I added gpg-agent support with my .bash_profile having&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[[ -e /Users/christopher.evans/.gnupg/S.gpg-agent.ssh ]] &amp;amp;&amp;amp; export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/Users/christopher.evans/.gnupg/S.gpg-agent.ssh&lt;/code&gt;. I actually don’t remember how I get the gpg agent to start, unless its something part of the GPGTool suite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that seemed to not work is U2F. I tried adding it to my GitHub account, I tried gmail, I even tried the &lt;a href=&quot;https://demo.yubico.com/u2f&quot;&gt;demo Yubico&lt;/a&gt; has. No joy, time to email support. Since I gave them the guide I used, they quickly pointed out that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ykpersonalize -m82&lt;/code&gt; was the right approach for YubiKey NEOs sold before September 2014. But since then U2F support has come out, and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-m86&lt;/code&gt; is needed. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-personalization/Manuals/ykpersonalize.1.html&quot;&gt;ykpersonalize&lt;/a&gt; man page describes the modes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;-m mode&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;set device configuration for the YubiKey. It is parsed in the form mode:cr_timeout:autoeject_timeout&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;where mode is:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;0
OTP device only.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;1
CCID device only.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;2
OTP/CCID composite device.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;3
U2F device only.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;4
OTP/U2F composite device.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;5
U2F/CCID composite device.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;6
OTP/U2F/CCID composite device. Add 80 to set MODE_FLAG_EJECT, for example: 81&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;cr_timeout is the timeout in seconds for the YubiKey to wait on button press for challenge response (default is 15)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;autoeject_timeout is the timeout in seconds before the card is automatically ejected in mode 81&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that quick fix, I now have a good GPG key, usable with SSH, and my accounts that can use U2F do. Recently Yubico has announced &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yubico.com/2016/09/yubikey-works-windows-hello/&quot;&gt;Windows 10 Hello&lt;/a&gt; support, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yubico.com/2016/09/yubikey-smart-card-support-for-macos-sierra-2/&quot;&gt;MacOS 10.12 Sierra&lt;/a&gt; support, and even has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yubico.com/2016/07/over-a-dozen-services-supporting-fido-u2f/&quot;&gt;short list of sites&lt;/a&gt; that support U2F.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Blog to follow: Julia Evans (@b0rk)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been following Julia Evans, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/b0rk&quot;&gt;@b0rk on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; for a while. But what inspired this post was me going through my Instapaper backlog. Her article &lt;a href=&quot;http://jvns.ca/blog/2016/04/30/building-expertise-at-work/&quot;&gt;How does knowledge get locked up in people’s heads? or, “Building expertise at work”&lt;/a&gt; has hit home for me because I’ve been with my company three years. I’ve had to find out how something works, and I’ve needed to pass on knowledge I’ve learned to others. She has written about &lt;a href=&quot;http://jvns.ca/blog/2016/05/22/how-do-you-write-blog-posts/&quot;&gt;why she blogs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://jvns.ca/blog/2016/06/12/a-weird-system-call-process-vm-readv/&quot;&gt;how to spy on what ruby is doing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She has also &lt;a href=&quot;http://jvns.ca/zines/&quot;&gt;started making zines&lt;/a&gt; about what she she’s learned. Currently stocked are: strace, and Linux debugging tools.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Switching to Jekyll!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This blog has gone without and to reboot I’m giving Jekyll a try. It was able to import my old posts with ease. At the same time, I’m migrating the site from a personal vm, to AWS’s CloudFront and S3. Pennies to run, and I get to play with AWS again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not making any promises of future updates, but that is what &lt;a href=&quot;/feed.xml&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; is for.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>I AM A LINUX ENTHUSIAST. Thanks SCaLE.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This blog post is the post is an edited draft of something &lt;a href=&quot;http://iam.reliam.com/?p=453&quot;&gt;I wrote up for one of my work&amp;#8217;s blogs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past month was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale11x&quot;&gt;11th annual Southern Califoria Linux Expo&lt;/a&gt;. It had been many years since I last went. For this visit, SCaLE has been extended to support other linux and FLOSS related events. On the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale11x/schedule/friday&quot;&gt;Friday&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reliam.com&quot;&gt;Reliam&lt;/a&gt; helped sponsor &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale11x/devops-day-la&quot;&gt;Devops Day LA&lt;/a&gt; which ties directly to what we at Reliam strive for by communicating with our clients. On &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale11x/schedule/saturday&quot;&gt;Saturday&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale11x/schedule/sunday&quot;&gt;Sunday&lt;/a&gt;, the classic SCaLE presentations occured. Also on the weekend, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale11x/exhibitors&quot;&gt;exhibition hall&lt;/a&gt; was open with many organizantions and companies. With so many different things to do, I had to miss out on stuff that I wish I could have had time for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to resort to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California_Linux_Expo&quot;&gt;SCaLE&amp;#8217;s Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; to find that I last went to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/past/2005/&quot;&gt;SCaLE 3x&lt;/a&gt;. My most vivid memory was attending the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/past/2005/speakers/speakers_strauss.php&quot;&gt;Open Source Telephony Using Asteristk and VOIP by Daryll Strauss&lt;/a&gt; presentation. I remember being fasinated with the concept of a free PBX, since at the time I worked for &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesae.k12.ca.us/&quot;&gt;The School of Arts &amp;amp; Enterprise&lt;/a&gt; and we had gone with two Nortel PBXs. We would have to call the main line for the other campus and hit the room extension, just to reach a teacher at the other site. When I looked at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/past/2005/scale3x_day1.php&quot;&gt;photos from the event&lt;/a&gt;, I also found the Flightgear mock up which I was fasinated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale11x/events&quot;&gt;several special events&lt;/a&gt; that where held because so many like minded individuals where at the same place. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale11x/mysql-community-day&quot;&gt;MySQL Community Day&lt;/a&gt; is one that I took advantage of. For many years, I&amp;#8217;ve helped Reliam&amp;#8217;s customers tune their databases so they get some of the best performance possible. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sheeri.com/&quot;&gt;Sheeri Cabral&lt;/a&gt; of Mozilla gave a talk on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale11x/presentations/are-you-getting-best-out-your-mysql-indexes&quot;&gt;Are You Getting the Best Out of Your MySQL Indexes?&lt;/a&gt;. She covered the basics, including use of multi-column indexing which I have used many times already. New to me was the use of &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/constraint-enum.html&quot;&gt;ENUM&lt;/a&gt;, because in the past used a SET where the ENUM will be a better description of what I mean. I also learned that mysql uses statistics on tables, and may not use indexes because it thinks that it will be faster to just read directly from the table instead of reading from an index and bouncing into the table for each match. Since Reliam has been using puppet to help manage the many hosts we run for our customers, I also attended a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale11x/puppet-camp-la&quot;&gt;Puppet Camp LA&lt;/a&gt; talk on a method of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale11x/presentations/hierarchical-systems-policy-management-puppetldap-environment-patrick-paul&quot;&gt;integrating puppet and ldap&lt;/a&gt;. This talk covered how people can optimize puppet control of systems in a massive environment. LDAP allows admins to nest computers into organizational units, so you can have the California group, the New York group, and the Tokyo group. Within each group, you could have a developer group that needs certain compilers and other software installed to get their job done. There could also be a group for site operations, and they use certain software to track conference room schedules, and peoples vacation and actual sick time. As the objects representing peoples computers got moved into a group, puppet would be using ldap to make sure that person got the right software. This is a contrived example, but there are cases where it has been chosen to run a lean install, with just the required software for each person to do their job. Reliam alumni &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/solarce&quot;&gt;Brandon Burton&lt;/a&gt; also gave a talk on how &lt;a href=&quot;https://speakerdeck.com/solarce/mozilla-and-puppet&quot;&gt;Mozilla uses puppet&lt;/a&gt;. He covered their best practices of using revision control, along with verification on code before checkin. Mozilla has built &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mozilla-it/puppetctl&quot;&gt;puppetctl&lt;/a&gt;, a tool to be their way of disabling puppet for a certain time period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made it in time to attend the keynote presentation for DevOps Day covering &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale11x/presentations/promise-theory-dummies&quot;&gt;Promise Theory&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.johnmwillis.com/&quot;&gt;John Willis&lt;/a&gt; talked about while tools like puppet, chef and others go for determininistic declarations of how a server or system should be, such statements may become harder to enforce as systems scale. In a more dynamic environment, Promise Theory would allow new pieces could get added, and gain trust amongst its peers. Since this was an abstract talk, much of it went in my ears without true comprehention. But I will remember this talk as I encounter larger scale systems. Later in the afternoon, I made it back to the DevOps talks with &lt;a href=&quot;http://cwebber.net/&quot;&gt;Christopher Webber&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://cwebberops.github.com/scale11x-tdd_for_ops/&quot;&gt;Test Driven Development for Ops&lt;/a&gt;. Use of tests can allow you to make sure stupid mistakes don&amp;#8217;t get put in by doing syntax checking. Linting allows the code to be reviewed for best practices, and catch things that are missing such as documentation. These were the easy steps in testing to do. Writing unit tests is a step up, since you have to write the test and know how to catch the corner/edge cases to have it work for the best benifet. For sysadmins, we are used to &amp;#8220;testing&amp;#8221; in production by constantly monitoring our systems, and verifying things are as we expect. Using configuration management tools to ensure that  monitor checks get setup simplfies the steps needed to bring new systems up to speed, or changed settings are confirmed. Integration of monitoring is something I can&amp;#8217;t wait to get implemented at Reliam. Brandon gave his second presentation with one of his co-workers &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cturra&quot;&gt;Chris Turra&lt;/a&gt; on how &lt;a href=&quot;http://people.mozilla.org/~cturra/mozilla-scaling-patterns/&quot;&gt;Mozilla scales the web properties&lt;/a&gt; they run. It was great to see the details of how other companies run at scale, both in technology and people. They have the &amp;#8220;Button&amp;#8221; that is used for deploying site updates via a tool they call chief. The next day the website for the Firefox Phone got updated, and Chris commented that in the past his team would have be the ones deploying the update. Instead it was just a click away. And to defend Reliam, we have made these tools for our customers too. Just so you don&amp;#8217;t think that this is something new to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday&amp;#8217;s keynote by &lt;a href=&quot;http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/&quot;&gt;Matthew Garrett&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale11x/presentations/secure-boot-journey&quot;&gt;The Secure Boot Journey&lt;/a&gt; was delivered to a packed room. He covered how when Microsoft initially released the hardware requirements for Windows 8 laptops, Linux may have gotten locked out from those systems. Windows 8 required that the hardware verify that what it was booting had been verified to be authorized, and Microsoft said that their keys had to be trusted if Windows 8 was to be sold on it. Since there was no requirement to be able to add other keys, you can be sure the manufactures would have skipped that ability, since the majority of people would not care. Matthew recounts how he was able to create such an outcry that Microsoft added the requirement that there be an interface to manage the keys trusted for booting on this new hardware. He also covered the tools that where written to assist in users booting and installing Linux by having these tools signed by the Microsoft key. The next talk I attended was on how &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale11x/presentations/scaling-systems-configuration-facebook&quot;&gt;Facebook approached scalling the management of their servers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.phildev.net/&quot;&gt;Phil Dibowitz&lt;/a&gt; covered the reasons why Facebook went with chef, such as the ability to make major changes to how the tool worked. Facebook reduced the reported data to the bare minimum, so it was a few kilobytes, instead of megabytes. He also covered that Facebook used both paid chef, and open source chef. With the paid version of chef, Facebook got early access to the 2012 port, which lead to drastic improvements of the resource usage of chef. In the afternoon, I geeked out with two talks on IPv6. The first one by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.delong.com/&quot;&gt;Owen DeLong&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.he.net/&quot;&gt;Hurricane Electric&lt;/a&gt; (a major IPv6 tunnel broker) covered the growth of the internet, and how IPv4 has run out at the higher levels. Next, the vollunteer who acted as head geek of the network at SCaLE gave a step by step talk on how to get your own linux router provide IPv6 addresses at home, even if your ISP doesn&amp;#8217;t give you any. I&amp;#8217;ve had a tunnel setup in the past, but since taken it down when I changed my home ISP. These talks reminded me that I should get that up again. The final presentation I was able to stick around for was facinating to me, and at just my level. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale11x/presentations/lightweight-virtualization-namespaces-cgroups-and-unioning-filesystems&quot;&gt;Linux Containers&lt;/a&gt; presentation by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jpetazzo&quot;&gt;Jérôme Petazzoni&lt;/a&gt; was about a group of technologies that help limit one group of programs from interfering with another group. Which is a great method to use when setting up a shared hosting environment. Configuring a new environtment for the next user takes mear minutes, and starting that environment up is typically seconds. This allows more environments to be running on one piece of hardware, and even more enviroments to be configured. Economies of scale at its finest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday was time for me to wind down. I went to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.semicomplete.com/&quot;&gt;Jordan Sissel&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://semicomplete.com/presentations/logstash-scale11x/&quot;&gt;talk on logstash&lt;/a&gt; which helped wake me up with humor. He covered how sysadmin&amp;#8217;s don&amp;#8217;t really like getting woken up in the middle of their sleep, just because a disk is getting full. A natural instinct is to delete all the logs. This is great for space, but when you need the information, causes you to curse your former self. Another problem described is level 1 tech support people needing access to logs, but security requiring restricted access. Tools are built to serve this purpose, but are often slow and difficult to use. Logstash to the rescue! With it, tech support personal can drill down to a required timeframe, search for a specific user. All in a single bound. And its pretty darn quick. I also went to a talk on automating installation of FreeBSD to expand my horizons, but I probably won&amp;#8217;t be making use of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my spare time, I strolled the exhibition hall. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linuxastronomy.org/&quot;&gt;LinuxAstronomy&lt;/a&gt; was back from last year, showing even more devices that are going into the sensor platform they plan to launch via a balloon. Awesome. &lt;a href=&quot;http://linuxmce.com/&quot;&gt;LinuxMCE&lt;/a&gt; would allow me to monitor and control my house. Its a slick looking thing compared to &lt;a href=&quot;http://misterhouse.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;MisterHouse&lt;/a&gt; from a decade ago. Mozilla was there, showing of prototypes of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/partners/&quot;&gt;FirefoxOS&lt;/a&gt;. I got to geek out, by working with Chris Turra in flashing one of the phones to a more recent build. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale11x/sponsor/odroid-hard-kernel&quot;&gt;ODROID Hard Kernel&lt;/a&gt; looked as a cool way to make your own systems, reminding me of the RaspberryPi. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openbsd.org/&quot;&gt;OpenBSD&lt;/a&gt; was there with swag, and classic copies of the OS. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale11x/sponsor/ticketmaster&quot;&gt;Ticketmaster&lt;/a&gt; deserves mention because they had Krispy Kreme doughnuts, and cat pictures. I personally don&amp;#8217;t know what started the fascination with cat pictures, but them putting them up there did make me chuckle. I got to talk with one of the guys from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale11x/sponsor/amd-seamicro&quot;&gt;AMD&amp;#8217;s SeaMicro&lt;/a&gt;, which packs a lot of processor power into a &amp;#8220;tiny&amp;#8221; space. They seem to be a nice fit for virtualization, or Linux containers. Because of DevOps Day LA, many of the configuration management platforms also had booths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunetly, I missed the talk on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/brendangregg/linux-performance-analysis-and-tools&quot;&gt;Linux Performance Analysis and Tools&lt;/a&gt;, and I&amp;#8217;ll just have to watch a &lt;a href=&quot;http://dtrace.org/blogs/brendan/2012/12/13/usenix-lisa-2012-performance-analysis-methodology/&quot;&gt;talk he gave in 2012&lt;/a&gt;. It might of been handy to go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale11x/presentations/packaging-software-non-programmers&quot;&gt;Redhat&amp;#8217;s talk on making packages&lt;/a&gt;. While the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale11x/presentations/introducing-continuous-integration-jenkins&quot;&gt;Jenkins talk&lt;/a&gt; was below me at the beginner level, it does deserve mention because its just darn cool, and I plan on setting one up again soon. If I ever find the time to play with hardware projects, I bet the talk on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale11x/presentations/pi-your-face-getting-hands-raspberry-pi&quot;&gt;Raspberry Pi&lt;/a&gt; would have been handy. There where many talks on filesystems that help people scale: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale11x/presentations/orangefs-next-generation-parallel-scale-out-file-system&quot;&gt;OrangeFS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale11x/presentations/glusterfs-sysadmins&quot;&gt;GlusterFS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale11x/presentations/ceph-managing-distributed-storage-system-scale&quot;&gt;Ceph&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale11x/presentations/zfs-administration&quot;&gt;ZFS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale11x/presentations/extending-nas-functionality-freenas-plugins-system&quot;&gt;FreeNAS Plugins&lt;/a&gt;. There where also BoF sessions that I wish I made it to: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale11x/presentations/inbound-and-outbound-spam-control-methods&quot;&gt;spam controls&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale11x/presentations/functional-programming&quot;&gt;functional programming&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale11x/aws-amazon-web-servcies&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale11x/coreboot-open-source-firmware-and-bootloaders-0&quot;&gt;coreboot&lt;/a&gt;. Now I remember why I loved college. I had so much time on my hands, I could get into and learn so many different things.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Blog to follow: A Few Thoughts on Cryptographic Engineering</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I came across Matthew Green&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/&quot;&gt;A Few Thoughts on Cryptographic Engineering&lt;/a&gt; blog recently, and have found the site worthy to follow. Everything I have read is well written, and informative. His &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2012/05/tale-of-two-patches.html&quot;&gt;A tale of two patches&lt;/a&gt; post covers some of the flaws in openssl that where patched in early 2012. While his &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2012/05/future-of-electronic-currency.html&quot;&gt;The future of electronic currency&lt;/a&gt; post does talk about our near future options for digial currency, it is more informative about what has been tried in the past, and reasons why it did not work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also tends to rant in his posts, giving his reasons why he thinks the way he does. In &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2011/11/bram-cohen-corrects-me.html&quot;&gt;Bram Cohen corrects me?&lt;/a&gt; the rant becomes a coversation between himself and Bram Cohen over two blog posts, and into the comments of both articles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have interest in cryptography from an opinionated researcher, pleese to checkout his blog.&lt;/p&gt;
