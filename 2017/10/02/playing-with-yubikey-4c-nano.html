    <p>Today I got my <a href="https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/yubikey4/">YubiKey 4C Nano</a> to join my ‘new’ work laptop. I figured I should follow up from my earlier post ‘<a href="/2016/09/29/playing-with-yubikey.html">Playing with: YubiKey4</a>’. I quickly added it to <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/u/1/signinoptions/two-step-verification">my Google account</a> and <a href="https://github.com/settings/two_factor_authentication/configure">GitHub</a>
Back in March, I got a <a href="https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/yubikey4/">Yubikey4</a>. Next was to import my existing GPG key to the card, and make new subkeys.</p>

<p>First to setup the device, I launched the GUI YubiKey Manager version 1.4.1. It prompted me to set the PIN. I then selected Manage device PINs, and configured a nice long random Management Key. After these steps, commands I was using to have gpg talk to the card were failing. I pulled the device from its port, re-inserted, and gpg –card-status worked.</p>

<p>Setting up the PIN didn’t seem to work for gpg, so I followed the <a href="https://www.yubico.com/support/knowledge-base/categories/articles/reset-applet-yubikey/">how to reset your applet on your YubiKey</a> to reset the defaults.</p>

<p>I then went to see if maybe my tools were out of date, and I downloaded version 1.4.2 of <a href="https://www.yubico.com/support/knowledge-base/categories/articles/piv-tools/">YubiKey PIV Manager</a> which seemed ‘slow’ to download, taking 2-4 minutes to download ~20 MB.</p>

<p>I still was messing up the PIN, but using the PIV Manager, I was able to reset the device, and assigned a PIN, and a long management key, which also allowed me to set a PUK. I skipped the Set Up YubiKey for MacOS, which would allow me to use my PIN with my key to login to my computer. This is because of FUD, I’d heard in the past that it might cause issues with gpg-agent being able to tie into the key too. And I use my finger print to login anyways, so no ease of use advantage there.</p>
