My profession is System Administration, taking care of servers for over a decade. Puppet has been my configuration system of choice since 2011. Security is important to me, and should be implemented near the beginning. I don't update my blog that often, subscribe <a href="{{ "/feed.xml" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">via RSS</a> if it interests you.
